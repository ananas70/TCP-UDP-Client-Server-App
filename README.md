# Client-Server Communication Application

This is the implementation of a client-server application utilizing TCP and UDP protocols for efficient message management. I developed mechanisms for connection multiplexing and data handling, creating functionalities that allow clients to subscribe and unsubscribe to topics. This design ensures real-time data transmission between multiple clients and a central server.
